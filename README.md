# Introduction

In this Project, we present an aggregation based visual query method for Multi-sources Spatial-temporal Data Analysis. 
Our contribution includes:

An aggregation based spatial-temporal data query engine that bridges the gap between multi-sources data and protects data privacy.

A visual query interface for interactively modifying the query conditions, investigating query results and refining the query process.

Two real-world usage scenarios based on real multi-sources urban datasets that demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.
